## Indexes

An index aims to track a group of stocks. They can be helpful to compare an individual stock to the broader market. Note that price movements are significantly dampened compared to individual companies.

Dow Jones (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and NASDAQ (^IXIC) are each different, and simply put:

- ^DJI: blue chips, the big, historical, well-known companies
- ^GSPC: large companies in general
- ^IXIC: weighted towards tech companies

They can be used to gauge the performance of market as a whole, and compared to a stock of interest. Which one to use is up to you, all three are included so you can pick.
